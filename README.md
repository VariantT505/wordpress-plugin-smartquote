Tired of WordPress changing your standard quotes in curly quotes? This plugin will disable it for you.

== Description ==

Wordpress is automatically changing quotes, and this is great in many cases.
But for some languages, like French for example, the quotes are totally messed up and the curly quotes are not correctly displayed.

This plugin will simply prevent WordPress to use the smart quotes. No need to touch your theme code and you can still update your theme, the plugin will always do its job.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* First stable version.
